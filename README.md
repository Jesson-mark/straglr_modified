# straglr_modified

Two modifications: 

The first one is to output some key information in different stages of `Straglr`, such as informing users how many loci are loaded and will be genotyped or when to construct input of `TRF` and when to run `GMM` for genotyping alleles of VNTRs. 

The second one is integrating `out_prefix` to temporary file of `TRF`.
